The `FreeformControls.ControlsManager` instance is used to `anchor` the controls onto objects, which gives access to a `Controls` object.
Each `Controls` object is made up of several "handles". These handles (like `Translation`, `Rotation`) can be tweaked and custom handles can also be attached to the controls.

The following sections detail the usage of the `ControlsManager`, `Controls`, and the default handles, as well as how to create custom handles.
